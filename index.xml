I&amp;rsquo;m Ronan and I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing role playing games, mainly D&amp;amp;D and derivitives, since the late 1970s. Here&amp;rsquo;s a rough timeline of my gaming life:&lt;/p>


&lt;div class="timeline">
 
 
 

&lt;div class="timeline-event timeline-event--">
 &lt;div class="timeline-event-label">1970s&lt;/div>
 The "red box" &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Basic_Set_(BECMI_D%26D)">Basic Rules Set&lt;/a> - my Dad gave it to me for Christmas.
 
&lt;/div>

 

&lt;div class="timeline-event timeline-event--">
 &lt;div class="timeline-event-label">1980s&lt;/div>
 I played &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Advanced_Dungeons_&amp;_Dragons_2nd_Edition">AD&amp;D 2nd Edition&lt;/a> for years - Ravenloft and its horrifying "Domains of Dread" was my favourite campaign setting.
 
&lt;/div>

 

&lt;div class="timeline-event timeline-event--">
 I really wanted to love &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_Role_Playing">MERP&lt;/a> but I never really got to grips with the rules. I'm not even sure I understood the character creation process! I played &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_Fantasy_Roleplay">WFRP&lt;/a> for a while.
 
&lt;/div>

 

&lt;div class="timeline-event timeline-event--">
 &lt;div class="timeline-event-label">1990s&lt;/div>
 I loved &lt;a target="_blank" href="">Cyberpunk 2020&lt;/a> and the various supplements. It's a vivid setting, primed for excitment and tension.
 
&lt;/div>

 

&lt;div class="timeline-event timeline-event--">
 &lt;div class="timeline-event-label">2010s&lt;/div>
 I ran a long campaign with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/5e">D&amp;D 5e&lt;/a> after convincing a group of work colleagues to adventure with me.
 
&lt;/div>

 

&lt;div class="timeline-event timeline-event--">
 &lt;div class="timeline-event-label">2020s&lt;/div>
 Like many others, finding Me, Myself and Die was a revelation and my solo adventures with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.wordmillgames.com/page/mythic-gme.html">Mythic GM Emulator&lt;/a> and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://peginc.com/savage-settings/savage-worlds/">Savage Worlds&lt;/a> began!
 
&lt;/div>

 

&lt;div class="timeline-event timeline-event--">
 Discovering the fantastic &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://tomkinpress.com/pages/ironsworn">Ironsworn&lt;/a>, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://tomkinpress.com/pages/ironsworn-starforged">Starforged&lt;/a> and &lt;a target="_blank" href="">Sundered Isles&lt;/a> showed me a whole new mechanical concept - fantastic!
 
&lt;/div>

 

&lt;div class="timeline-event timeline-event--">
 &lt;div class="timeline-event-label">2023&lt;/div>
 I was lucky enough to kickstart Kelsey Dionne's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark">Shadowdark RPG&lt;/a> and it brought the possibility of introducing 5the Edition players to a simpler, faster, grittier system.
 
&lt;/div>

 

&lt;div class="timeline-event timeline-event--">
 &lt;div class="timeline-event-label">2025&lt;/div>
 The West Marches call and, in the company of thirteen doughty companions (aka work colleagues and friends), I set off to face unknown perils...
 
&lt;/div>

&lt;p>The artwork used on the site is currently created by AI. I use ChatGPT and have supplied my own photographs to inspire characters or places in the images. At the moment, this blog is a tiny drop in a vast ocean of content. I hope that should it ever become more than that, I will commission a human artist to create the artwork instead.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
