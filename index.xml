I&amp;rsquo;m intending to keep this article up to date with any new or modified rules I might adopt in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No fudging dice &lt;em>ever&lt;/em> - the rolls always stand&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Critical fumble results in missing your next turn&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First level characters automatically get maximum hit points - they don&amp;rsquo;t need to roll.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When rolling first level characters, roll 3d6 for 6 stats and then arrange them as you wish.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Odinson Games Chaotic Combat</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/11/odinson-games-chaotic-combat/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/11/odinson-games-chaotic-combat/</guid><description>Injecting more crazy into combat</description></item><item><title>The Discovery</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/11/the-discovery/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/11/the-discovery/</guid><description>An actual play experiment with D&amp;amp;D OSE</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Five</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-five/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-five/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m really hungry. Just been rooting about in the cupboards and found a few things. A packet of stale biscuits (ate them - they were ok, better than nothing) and a deck of cards.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Four</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-four/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-four/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s 6:23am and I&amp;rsquo;m freezing.

The day started so well! Managed to get the fire going and it lasted until first light, around 8am. The dawn was spectacular - the cabin must be facing southeast because the sun rose over the mountains away to the left.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry One</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-one/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-one/</guid><description>Wow! This place is amazing! It took a while to get here - snow on the roads and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty remote. Google maps took me the wrong way and I ended up at a gate on a cliff - had to find my own way for the last hour or so.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Two</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-two/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-two/</guid><description>Man it&amp;rsquo;s cold!!! I must have fallen asleep last night. The fire&amp;rsquo;s almost out and it looks like the snow really came down during the night as there are 6 foot drifts outside.</description></item><item><title>Mountaintop Isolation - First Look</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/mountaintop-isolation-first-look/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/mountaintop-isolation-first-look/</guid><description>One of my favourite radio shows from the dim and distant past was &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/CBC_NightfallOTR">Nightfall&lt;/a>, creepy and disturbing stories of all sorts that used the power of radio and imagination to tell terrifying tales.</description></item><item><title>Sinister Forest Discoveries</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/05/sinister-forest-discoveries/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/05/sinister-forest-discoveries/</guid><description>A d20 random table of discoveries characters might make in a sinister forest</description></item><item><title>Licensing Information</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/licensing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/licensing/</guid><description>&lt;p>Content on this site is released under a &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International&lt;/a> license.
