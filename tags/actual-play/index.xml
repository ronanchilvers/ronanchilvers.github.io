Rain drums on the window shutters and seeps through in thin threads that trickle down the glass.</description></item><item><title>House Rules</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/11/house-rules/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/11/house-rules/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m using a few house rules while playing, inspired by (or pinched from) sources such as &lt;a href="https://taleofthemanticore.blogspot.com">Tale of the Manticore&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;m intending to keep this article up to date with any new or modified rules I might adopt in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No fudging dice &lt;em>ever&lt;/em> - the rolls always stand&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Critical fumble results in missing your next turn&lt;/li>
&lt;li>First level characters automatically get maximum hit points - they don&amp;rsquo;t need to roll.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When rolling first level characters, roll 3d6 for 6 stats and then arrange them as you wish.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>The Discovery</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/11/the-discovery/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/11/the-discovery/</guid><description>An actual play experiment with D&amp;amp;D OSE</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Five</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-five/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-five/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m really hungry. Just been rooting about in the cupboards and found a few things. A packet of stale biscuits (ate them - they were ok, better than nothing) and a deck of cards.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Four</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-four/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-four/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s 6:23am and I&amp;rsquo;m freezing. I managed to keep the fire going but the wind from the bust roof was howling through the cabin all night and I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get warm.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Three</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-three/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-three/</guid><description>Dammit! The day started so well! Managed to get the fire going and it lasted until first light, around 8am. The dawn was spectacular - the cabin must be facing southeast because the sun rose over the mountains away to the left.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry One</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-one/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-one/</guid><description>Wow! This place is amazing! It took a while to get here - snow on the roads and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty remote. Google maps took me the wrong way and I ended up at a gate on a cliff - had to find my own way for the last hour or so.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Two</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-two/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-two/</guid><description>Man it&amp;rsquo;s cold!!! I must have fallen asleep last night. The fire&amp;rsquo;s almost out and it looks like the snow really came down during the night as there are 6 foot drifts outside.</description></item></channel></rss>
