Sunlight flashes off the brackish water of the lake and glimmers of the drenched wooden pylons of the great sea gate, its massive door standing open allowing passage for the fishing boats and merchant ships that frequent these waters.</description></item><item><title>S01E00 - Introduction</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2026/01/s01e00/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2026/01/s01e00/</guid><description>So - we are about to set foot in the Twelve Duchies for the first time. I have three characters already, taken from the fiction that I wrote years ago. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with a sort of solo session zero and outline a bit about them. I&amp;rsquo;m being intentionally brief - I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend too much time on it as I&amp;rsquo;d rather details emerge through the story.</description></item><item><title>House Rules</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/11/house-rules/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/11/house-rules/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m using a few house rules and mechanics while playing, inspired by (or pinched from) sources such as Tale of the Manticore.</description></item><item><title>The Discovery</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/11/the-discovery/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/11/the-discovery/</guid><description>An actual play experiment with D&amp;amp;D OSE</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Five</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/06/journal-entry-five/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/06/journal-entry-five/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m really hungry. Just been rooting about in the cupboards and found a few things. A packet of stale biscuits (ate them - they were ok, better than nothing) and a deck of cards.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Four</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/06/journal-entry-four/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/06/journal-entry-four/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s 6:23am and I&amp;rsquo;m freezing.

The day started so well! Managed to get the fire going and it lasted until first light, around 8am. The dawn was spectacular - the cabin must be facing southeast because the sun rose over the mountains away to the left.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Two</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/06/journal-entry-two/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/06/journal-entry-two/</guid><description>Man it&amp;rsquo;s cold!!! I must have fallen asleep last night. The fire&amp;rsquo;s almost out and it looks like the snow really came down during the night as there are 6 foot drifts outside.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry One</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/06/journal-entry-one/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/06/journal-entry-one/</guid><description>Wow! This place is amazing! It took a while to get here - snow on the roads and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty remote. Google maps took me the wrong way and I ended up at a gate on a cliff - had to find my own way for the last hour or so.</description></item></channel></rss>
