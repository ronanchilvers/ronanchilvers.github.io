Her new &ldquo;temple&rdquo; is a single damp room off the square, shutters swollen, dust furred thick on the floor. She shoulders the door, coughs at the smell, and sets her pack down - she can&rsquo;t help feeling a little disappointed. &ldquo;Have to start somewhere I suppose. Shallya - make this room is just the beginning!&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>A voice comes from the threshold. &ldquo;You the new Sister?&rdquo; He is broad in the shoulders, rain on his beard, a loaf under his arm and a jug in his hand. &ldquo;Name’s Hadley,&rdquo; he says, stepping in without fuss. &ldquo;Welcome to Southome.&rdquo; He sets bread on the bare altar and the jug beside it and holds out a hand in greeting. His grip is strong and warm.</em></p><p>*The town reeve, Myer Olney, arrives with questions and a frown - it seems the paperwork allowing her to establish a temple, however small, in Southome is unfinished. Soon after the landlord, Brinley Cantor, marches in. When he sees she&rsquo;s young, his tone turns patronising and with false apologies, he tells her the rent is higher than expected and oh - there are three leaks in the roof. Tasha squares her shoulders, produces the required paperwork for the reeve and argues back about the rent; her voice is steady but she&rsquo;s tired. Hadley quietly takes a place at her side. &ldquo;She’s here to mend folk, Myer, not cheat them,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the paperwork is fine. And you Brinley - you&rsquo;ve supped at my table for free often enough to owe me a favour or two. Two coppers less and a man on the roof by sundown.&rdquo; The landlord grumbles but Hadley doesn’t blink. &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; the man says at last, grudgingly.</p><p><em>Tasha lets out a breath she didn’t know she was holding. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she says.</em></p><p><em>&ldquo;Don’t thank me yet,&rdquo; Hadley answers, smiling at her &ldquo;Wait till it rains!&rdquo; He grins again. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not a bad sort here - just a bit isolated and suspicious of newcomers. I&rsquo;ve been here ten years and they still call me the &rsquo;new landlord of the tavern&rsquo;!&rdquo;. They laugh together.</em></p><p><em>Supplies are meagre to say the least: a cracked mortar and pestle, a few candle stubs, some scraps of linen. Tasha boils water, scrubs and cleans the room and lays out the holy symbol, the dove, where it can be seen on the small altar. Hadley returns before dusk with a bundle of old but clean cloth, a box of stubby candles and a boy from the cooper to put a band round the mortar. &ldquo;You don’t owe me Sister,&rdquo; he says when she reaches for her purse. &ldquo;Call it an investment in keeping my patrons healthy enough to drink an ale or two.&rdquo; She smiles - &ldquo;Then I owe you healthy patrons,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Do your best Sister, do your best!&rdquo; he says, and helps her fix the shutters so they close and lock properly.</em></p><p><em>Later, in the Dancing Bear, he brings her a bowl of warm stew and a hunk of bread. They sit near the warm hearth and for the first time, she feels welcome. Hadley raises an eyebrow when he hears she&rsquo;s from Kethryn. &ldquo;Kethryn’s a long road,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; she answers. &ldquo;But Shallya guided my steps. I hope I&rsquo;ll prove worthy of her grace and she&rsquo;ll guide me still.&rdquo; He nods like he understands. &ldquo;Faith is a wonderful thing&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I lost mine a good while back - can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve missed it overmuch. But I can see your calling in your face Sister.&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>Hadley leans back in his chair. &ldquo;You set your door open tomorrow,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;and I’ll send anyone I hear coughing.&rdquo; She meets his eye, smiling. &ldquo;Thank you. And thank you for the welcome.&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>It is a small moment, quiet and brief, but it catches. The first warmth of friendship settles between them.</em></p><h2 id=present-day>Present Day</h2><blockquote class="alert alert--note"><h4 class=alert__title>Overview</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Location: Southome
Characters:</p><ul><li>Tasha</li></ul><p>Time of day: Mid morning</p><p>Weather: Light drizzle, occasional sunshine</p></div></blockquote><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Questions</h4><div class=alert__content><p>The story took quite a turn in the last chapter. I had expected (and hoped) that Hadley would be a persistent character in the story - unfortunately the dice had other ideas. I think I need to decide a couple of things before the story continues.</p><p>We know the orcs were pursuing Elena, the elven woman, but we don&rsquo;t know why. Neither do we know if the surviving orc found her. I think it&rsquo;s most likely that she was killed - they had already shot her with a crossbow so they obviously weren&rsquo;t too worried about taking her alive. I&rsquo;m going to ask the Oracle a &ldquo;Likely&rdquo; question to see if she was killed as well.</p><p>Was Elena killed also? Likely - <del>2</del>, 8 - No</p><p>Is she still here? Unlikely - 2, <del>19</del> - No</p><p>Interesting! Captured? Or maybe escaped?</p></div></blockquote><p>It had been dreadful. The site of the tavern, broken and violated. Hadley, lifeless in the doorway with that terrible wound in his side. Tasha had been too shocked to show her emotions then, even though she knew at first sight that her friend was beyond her help. And then there were the creatures in the stairwell - she&rsquo;s heard of creatures like them before but has never seen them. Now, standing in the shattered, storm torn taproom of the tavern she feels the tears welling up.</p><p>The scene had told a terrible tale. An attack during the night, Hadley killing the two in the stairwell before a third&mldr; Tasha can&rsquo;t even speak the thought in her mind. The shock of it is still coursing through her. But the why of it, that&rsquo;s what she couldn&rsquo;t see, couldn&rsquo;t conceive. Why were these creatures here and what did they want with him?</p><p>They took Hadley away a little while ago and the bodies of the two creatures have been dumped outside. She can hear Myer Olney talking to the others, presumably panicking as he always does. She catches herself mid thought - she had been going to make a mental note to get Hadley to speak to him. The tears well up and her vision blurs.</p><p>There was something though. Something strange. She had run up the stairwell, thinking that the two creatures were &mldr; human. It had been a shock to find they weren&rsquo;t but she had been almost more shocked by the blood that was pooled all over the floor boards on the upstairs landing. Hadley was downstairs - it couldn&rsquo;t be his and the dark ichor that the orcs bled was very different. She had almost missed the dagger - only when she glanced back at the scene from the stairwell did she catch the glint of something from beneath a small table that stood against the wall.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Questions</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Since Elena isn&rsquo;t here there would be very little left, if anything, to show she was present at all. I decided that Tasha would find something and the elf&rsquo;s dagger came to mind. She had drawn it while Hadley fought the orcs in the stairwell and it makes sense to me that when she collapsed on the floor, the dagger skittered away under a table.</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to give Tasha a chance to recognise the elven workmanship. I think that&rsquo;s going to be an INT check - Tasha&rsquo;s INT is 13 so she&rsquo;ll need a 13 or lower on a d20.</p><p>Tasha INT - 13</p><p>Just on the button!</p></div></blockquote><p>She crouches and draws the knife from the gloom, turning it to catch the light. Elven work, she recognises at once—the line of the blade too clean for any village forge, the balance incredibly fine. Delicate runes trace along the hilt, but she can&rsquo;t read them, their grace marred by the dark tack of blood on the leather. Not spattered along the edge, but smeared where a wounded hand would grip. How does a thing like this come to be here? And if the blood on the landing is not Hadley’s—Shallya keep him—then whose? She glances toward the stair and the voices beyond, then slips the dagger into the fold of her robe.</p><p>Once outside again, she crosses towards the small group clustered around the bodies of the two orcs. Their greenish grey skin is turning livid in the morning light and the stench from them is strong, even for one used to the stench of hospital sick beds. Camryn Clay, a ranger who lives a little way north of Southome, is crouching next to them. He looks up as Tasha approaches.</p><p>&ldquo;Claw Hands, from the western reaches of the Marble Mountains in Dalma. Wide, rough country between us and them.&rdquo; He stands slowly, his face impassive - &ldquo;Hadley did well to dispatch two of them on his own - they&rsquo;re vicious.&rdquo;</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Questions</h4><div class=alert__content><p>I don&rsquo;t know how well Tasha knows Camryn or who he is. I&rsquo;ll use UNE to get some details about him.</p><ul><li>UNE Prompt: Unreasonable Monk</li><li>UNE Power Level: Comparable</li><li>UNE Motivation: Undermine Discretion</li></ul><p>We&rsquo;ve already suggested that Camryn is a ranger of some sort. The above descriptions make me think that he is a rather irritating know it all who likes to show off his knowledge. I wonder if Tasha has had run-ins with him before?</p><p>Does Tasha know Camryn quite well? Likely - 18 - Yes</p><p>Being a forgiving sort I think Tasha would usually be polite to him.</p></div></blockquote><p>Tasha frowns - &ldquo;Why would they be here? And attacking a village no less! It doesn&rsquo;t look like there were many of them - three or four? Is there any sign of others?&rdquo;</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Questions</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Does Camryn know how many from their tracks? 50/50 - 13 - Yes but&mldr;</p></div></blockquote><p>Camryn rocks back on his heels - &ldquo;Three I think - the storm washed most of the tracks away. I suspect there was someone else here as well though. There&rsquo;s blood on the floor of the taproom that it isn&rsquo;t orc blood and Hadley was by the door.&rdquo;</p><p>Tasha nods - the dagger feels suddenly heavy inside her robe. She feels a compulsion to reveal it but something stops her. &ldquo;Look - I need to get back to the temple. Bring Hadley to me and I&rsquo;ll &mldr; I&rsquo;ll prepare him for burial.&rdquo;</p><p>She turns on her heel and walks away from the tavern, tears prickling the corners of her eyes. She starts to recite Shallya&rsquo;s Creed, asking the goddess to bless her friend. About halfway home she stops, the tears becoming sobs and then she is leaning against a tree, crying silently into her hands, her shoulders trembling.</p></article><section class=np><div class="np__button np__button--previous">&#171; <a href=/2025/11/chapter-1-interlude/ title="S1 - Interlude - Well.
