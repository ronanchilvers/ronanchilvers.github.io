I feel bereft, as if I&rsquo;ve lost an old friend.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve read <a href=/2025/11/chapter-1-part-1/>part 1</a> and <a href=/2025/11/chapter-1-part-2/>part 2</a> of the first chapter of my foray into the Twelve Duchies (a setting I <a href=/2025/11/the-discovery/>created a long time ago and have rediscovered</a>) you will know that the Twelve Duchies have already seen their first character death. I&rsquo;m finding it a genuinely sad moment. Hadley is a character that appeared in the original (and quite bad) fiction I wrote for this setting way back in the early 1990s. I tend to use the name Hadley for my first character when I&rsquo;m learning about new systems. I&rsquo;m currently playing a coop <a href=https://tomkinpress.com/pages/ironsworn-starforged>Starforged</a> game and my character is named Hadley - a tough, straightforward, brave but single minded character that I&rsquo;m enjoying playing.</p><p>But this Hadley - the one that owned the &ldquo;Dancing Bear&rdquo; tavern in Southome, the first character to slowly emerge from the imaginative fog as the Twelve Duchies was born - he was the original.</p><p>Role playing games are powerful things. Mike Shea of Sly Flourish is of the opinion that <a href=https://slyflourish.com/playing_dnd_can_save_your_life.html>they can save your life</a>. Certainly they have power to cement friendships and promote social cohesion but they are also powerful emotional generators. Maybe because we&rsquo;re invested in the stories we create, maybe because of the fickle nature of the dice, role playing games can make us feel deeply. Decisions seem consequential, danger feels frightening and loss is sharp.</p><p>Sleep peacefully Hadley, old friend.</p></article><section class=np><div class="np__button np__button--previous">&#171; <a href=/2025/11/house-rules/ title="House Rules - I&rsquo;m using a few house rules and mechanics while playing, inspired by (or pinched from) sources such as Tale of the Manticore.">House Rules</a></div><div class="np__button np__button--next"></div></section></main><footer><p><a href=/about/>About</a> - <a href=/licensing/>Licensing</a> - <a href=/posts/index.xml>RSS</a></p></footer></body></html>
