Buried in a pile of stuff that I&rsquo;ve not looked at in years, I found two maps that I created way back when my D&amp;D adventures in other worlds had just begun. One was a world map and the other a map of one of the main continents named &ldquo;The Twelve Duchies&rdquo;.</p><figure><img src=/images/twelve-duchies/the-discovery/twelve-duchies.jpg alt="The Twelve Duchies" width=100%></figure><p>Tucked in between the two sheets of paper was a short bit of fiction I wrote - the start of an adventure in my own world. A tired, world weary innkeeper with a past, an enthusiastic young cleric and a pursued elven woman all made an appearance in the first few pages. Exciting stuff! I never played a game in this world however. Over the last few years I&rsquo;ve been getting more and more into playing RPGs solo. A light bulb moment - why not roll up some characters and go adventuring in this world that my far younger self dreamed up!</p><h2 id=enter-stage-left---old-school-essentials>Enter Stage Left - Old School Essentials</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to the excellent <a href=https://www.taleofthemanticore.com/>Tale of the Manticore</a> recently and have been itching to try out a bit of B/X D&amp;D. As luck would have it I bought a <a href=https://www.humblebundle.com/>Humble Bundle</a> deal some time ago which included the player and referee tomes for <a href=https://necroticgnome.com/pages/about-old-school-essentials>Old School Essentials</a> - perfect for a foray into the Twelve Duchies.</p><p>I&rsquo;m intending to post short actual play write ups here as I wander this world from my younger self&rsquo;s imagination. What wonders, monsters, dangers and treasures did I leave for my future self to discover!?</p></article><section class=np><div class="np__button np__button--previous"></div><div class="np__button np__button--next"><a href=/2025/11/house-rules/ title="House Rules - I&rsquo;m using a few house rules and mechanics while playing, inspired by (or pinched from) sources such as Tale of the Manticore.">House Rules</a> &#187;</div></section></main><footer><p><a href=/about/>About Me</a> - <a href=/licensing/>Licensing</a> - <a href=/posts/index.xml>RSS</a></p></footer></body></html>
