I must have fallen asleep last night. The fire&rsquo;s almost out and it looks like the snow really came down during the night as there are 6 foot drifts outside. It&rsquo;s around 6am I think - still dark. I&rsquo;m going to have to get some more wood in at some point - I put the last couple of logs on the fire a few minutes ago.</p><p>There&rsquo;s no one else here. I tried ringing Matt, and Ellie as well, but there&rsquo;s no signal. I&rsquo;m guessing that the snowfall has given them a load of hassle getting here. I might hike back to the car once it&rsquo;s light and see if there&rsquo;s any sign of them - they&rsquo;ll probably need help getting bags and stuff through the drifts - Ellie and Sam always bring too much stuff!!!</p><p>I&rsquo;m glad I won&rsquo;t be on my own up here. It&rsquo;s beautiful but it feels like I&rsquo;m on the edge of the wilds, kind of unwelcome. Strange feeling.</p><p>I read about some hikers a few years ago who got lost on the trails on these mountains during snow season. They were never seen again. I suppose there are still wild places where humans aren&rsquo;t welcome.</p></article><section class=np><div class="np__button np__button--previous">&#171; <a href=/2025/06/journal-entry-one/ title="Journal Entry One - Wow! This place is amazing! It took a while to get here - snow on the roads and it&rsquo;s pretty remote. Google maps took me the wrong way and I ended up at a gate on a cliff - had to find my own way for the last hour or so.">Journal Entry One</a></div><div class="np__button np__button--next"><a href=/2025/06/journal-entry-three/ title="Journal Entry Three - Dammit! The day started so well! Managed to get the fire going and it lasted until first light, around 8am. The dawn was spectacular - the cabin must be facing southeast because the sun rose over the mountains away to the left.">Journal Entry Three</a> &#187;</div></section></main><footer><p><a href=/about/>About</a> - <a href=/licensing/>Licensing</a> - <a href=/posts/index.xml>RSS</a></p></footer></body></html>
