Just been rooting about in the cupboards and found a few things. A packet of stale biscuits (ate them - they were ok, better than nothing) and a deck of cards.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Four</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-four/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-four/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s 6:23am and I&amp;rsquo;m freezing. I managed to keep the fire going but the wind from the bust roof was howling through the cabin all night and I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get warm.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Three</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-three/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-three/</guid><description>Dammit! The day started so well! Managed to get the fire going and it lasted until first light, around 8am. The dawn was spectacular - the cabin must be facing southeast because the sun rose over the mountains away to the left.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Two</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-two/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-two/</guid><description>Man it&amp;rsquo;s cold!!! I must have fallen asleep last night. The fire&amp;rsquo;s almost out and it looks like the snow really came down during the night as there are 6 foot drifts outside.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry One</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-one/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/journal-entry-one/</guid><description>Wow! This place is amazing! It took a while to get here - snow on the roads and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty remote. Google maps took me the wrong way and I ended up at a gate on a cliff - had to find my own way for the last hour or so.</description></item><item><title>Mountaintop Isolation - First Look</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/mountaintop-isolation-first-look/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/posts/2025/06/mountaintop-isolation-first-look/</guid><description>One of my favourite radio shows from the dim and distant past was &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/CBC_NightfallOTR">Nightfall&lt;/a>, creepy and disturbing stories of all sorts that used the power of radio and imagination to tell terrifying tales.</description></item></channel></rss>
