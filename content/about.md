Hi! I'm Ronan and I've been playing role playing games, mainly D&D and derivitives, since the late 1970s. Here's a rough timeline of my gaming life:

{{< timeline >}}

  {{< event label="1980s">}}
    The "red box" <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Basic_Set_(BECMI_D%26D)">Basic Rules Set</a> - my Dad gave it to me for Christmas.
  {{< /event >}}
  {{< event >}}
    I played <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Advanced_Dungeons_&_Dragons_2nd_Edition">AD&D 2nd Edition</a> for years - Ravenloft and its horrifying "Domains of Dread" was my favourite campaign setting.
  {{< /event >}}
  {{< event >}}
    I really wanted to love <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_Role_Playing">MERP</a> but I never really got to grips with the rules. I'm not even sure I understood the character creation process! I played <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_Fantasy_Roleplay">WFRP</a> for a while.
  {{< /event >}}
  {{< event label="1990s">}}
    I discovered and loved <a target="_blank" href="https://talsorianstore.com/collections/cyberpunk/products/cyberpunk-2020">Cyberpunk 2020</a> and the various supplements including the spinoff <a href="https://talsorianstore.com/collections/cybergeneration/products/cybergeneration-digital-pdf">Cyber Generation</a>. It's a vivid setting, primed for excitment and tension.
  {{< /event >}}
  {{< event label="2010s">}}
    I ran a long campaign with <a target="_blank" href="https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/5e">D&D 5e</a> after convincing a group of work colleagues to adventure with me.
  {{< /event >}}
  {{< event label="2020s" >}}
    Like many others, finding Me, Myself and Die was a revelation and my solo adventures with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wordmillgames.com/page/mythic-gme.html">Mythic GM Emulator</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://peginc.com/savage-settings/savage-worlds/">Savage Worlds</a> began!
  {{< /event >}}
  {{< event >}}
    Discovering the fantastic <a target="_blank" href="https://tomkinpress.com/pages/ironsworn">Ironsworn</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://tomkinpress.com/pages/ironsworn-starforged">Starforged</a> and <a target="_blank" href="">Sundered Isles</a> showed me a whole new mechanical concept - fantastic!
  {{< /event >}}
  {{< event label="2023" >}}
    I was lucky enough to kickstart Kelsey Dionne's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark">Shadowdark RPG</a> and it brought the possibility of introducing 5the Edition players to a simpler, faster, grittier system.
  {{< /event >}}
  {{< event label="2025" >}}
    The West Marches call and, in the company of thirteen doughty companions (aka work colleagues and friends), I set off to face unknown perils...
  {{< /event >}}
  {{< event >}}
    Two old friends and I start a Starforged cooperative campaign, having a blast!
  {{< /event >}}
  {{< event >}}
    I start work on my <a href="/2025/11/victorian-street-urchins/">Victorian street urchin game</a>, working title "Streetwise".
  {{< /event >}}
  {{< event label="2026" >}}
    Streetwise sees its first playtest with two of my most dedicated players. The streets of 1890s London begin to emerge from the smog.
  {{< /event >}}
  {{< event >}}
    I start an Ironsworn cooperative game with a friend who has been adventuring solo with <a href="https://castlegrief.itch.io/kal-arath">Castle Grief's Kal-Arath</a>. A fabulously grim adventure ensues.
