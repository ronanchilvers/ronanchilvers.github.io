## A note about artwork

The artwork used on the site is currently created by AI. I use ChatGPT and have supplied my own photographs to inspire characters or places in the images. At the moment, this blog is a tiny drop in a vast ocean of content. I hope that should it ever become more than that, I will commission a human artist to create the artwork instead.
