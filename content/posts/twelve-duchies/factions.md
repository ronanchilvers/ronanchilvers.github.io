Lore is important in a D&D setting. It helps set the scene, gives context and helps the GM develop the story. [Sly Flourish] wrote an article a while ago about [factions in your campaign]. To quote the article

> Without the unique story and lore of our game world, one game can seem much like the others. Lore sets apart one campaign from another. It wraps the framework of our RPGs in tapestries depicting many worlds beyond this one.

I'm going to keep a list of factions on this page so I can keep track of them. The descriptions will be brief - just enough detail to remind me where and what they are.

## Kethryn, Cern

### The Rook Brothers

Jarik and Malen Rook run a low level crime racket in the docks of Kethryn, captial city of Cern. They are involved in protection, smuggling and other unpleasantness.

*NPCs*
- Jarik and Malen Rook
- Joss Ketter - Sly, cruel enforce for the Rooks. Ketter enjoys making people suffer.
- Harl Fen - Huge, muscular bruiser. The frequent sidekick of Joss Ketter. Fen likes hitting things.
