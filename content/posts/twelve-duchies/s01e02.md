Berrin leads them away from the waterside at a careful pace, favouring his good leg as he threads them through the press of the docks. They pass between stacked crates and drying racks, past market stalls, haggling merchants and crews unloading cargos. No one pays them any heed now; the moment has passed, absorbed by the harbour’s constant motion.

The wharf road rises ahead, a long timbered way set on thick pilings driven deep into the lakebed. Water moves beneath it, dark and restless, slapping softly against the supports. From here the docks stretch away behind them in a tangle of masts, smoke and noise, while ahead the road runs straight toward the shore, narrowing as it goes, leading them toward the lower city beyond.

Berrin keeps to the side, out of the path of carts and foot traffic, leaning on Hadley's arm to steady himself. Gradually the noise changes, the lake sounds giving way, little by little, to the deeper hum of the lower city.

They make slow progress along the wharf road, the crowds growing as the road narrows and the crowds heading to the fish markets merge with travellers bound for the lower city. Carts creak past, drivers shout warnings, and the timber beneath their feet creaks and groans in quiet protest.

Off to one side, a group of street urchins sit perched on a line of empty barrels. Five of them, filthy faces, bare feet and ragged clothes, watching the crowds pass by. They spot Hadley and the others at once - backpacks, unfamiliar faces, definitely new arrivals.

Shared glances flick back and forth and then they are jumping down and racing after them, darting through legs and wheels before clustering around the group. They keep pace easily, talking over one another in a rush of voices, questions and comments, all tumbling together. They crowd close, the din of the docks now mixed with eager, insistent chatter.

Berrin’s expression sours as the urchins close in. “Alright, alright—enough of that,” he grumbles. He spots two familiar faces in the press and his tone sharpens. “Jory. Linnet. Don’t give me those innocent looks—I’ve seen you lot working the wharf.”

A couple of the kids recoil at being named, then brighten. “Berrin!” one of them protests, half-laughing. “We ain’t done nuffin.”

“Not yet,” Berrin mutters, wagging a finger. “And you won’t here neither. Go on—off with you.”

Tasha’s hand catches his sleeve. "It's alright, friend Berrin. They're harmless I think."

Berrin frowns and begins to protest but, with an easy smile, Tsha digs into her pouch and flips a few coins into the nearest open hands. The effect is immediate. The children surge in with a chorus of eager voices, crowding around her, trying to get close. Questions tumble out over one another. Where are they from? Are they adventurers? Does she have more?

Hadley’s shoulders tighten. He shifts his pack higher and keeps one hand near his belt, his eyes trying to keep track of the small hands that dart and hover. Too many hands, too much noise, too little space—exactly the sort of moment that ends with an empty pocket and no money for their lodgings. A slight rumble of anger rises in his chest.

> I'm wondering just how taken with Tasha these kids are. Let's give her a Charisma roll to find out.
> She has a Charisma of 12.
> 
> Tasha CHA - 16
> 
> Just the promise of coins then and maybe some excitement about new arrivals

But then Hadley realises the hands aren’t searching for a stray pouch or loose belt - they are only reaching toward the coins. Berrin clicks his tongue, still gruff, but not unkind. “Take the lady's gifts and be off with you, then. Don’t make us regret it.”

The kids laugh and run off, calling out thanks to the "kind lady" and maybe a couple of crude names to Berrin. He calls after them, "And don't trouble these good people again, neither. They've no time for the likes of you!"

Hadley relaxes, as space clears a little around them. Tasha smiles at him - "We still have our money Hadley. Just children - bold as hungry sparrows, but children nonetheless."

Hadley grunts and frowning, hefts his pack. "Lead on Berrin".

> Oh crikey! The dice are toying with me! Something extremely definitely happens but it's extremely not Fen and Ketter. I'm going to take that to mean it's a new event - I'll handle this with Mythic's Random Events table.

> Oh.

They have barely taken a step when one of the urchins darts back through the crowd, breathless with an intent on expression on his face. He fixes on Tasha, ignoring the others.

“You’re the Shallyan, aren’t you? The healer?”

“I am,” Tasha says.

He nods quickly. “Thought so. The lady on the shrine road told me to watch the boats this morning. Said one would come. Said I’d know you when I saw you. She told me not to say nothin' to anyone else.”

Hadley’s gaze sharpens. “What lady?”

“Don’t know her name. She said to tell you to find the house with a willow tree, just before the shrine.” He shrugs. “Gave me a coin to watch for you. Said it was important you didn’t delay.”

Elena is very still, her eyes glittering in the shadows of her hood.

“How did this lady of yours know we were coming?” Hadley asks.

The boy spreads his hands. “She just said you would.”

He points inland, toward the road climbing away from the lake, just visible beyond the lower city to the north.

“That way - on the old shrine road."

Before they can ask more the boy is off, vanishing into the crowds.

> It seemed to me that the creepiness of being expected and the slight threat of no delay would satisfy the descriptors. That and of course progressing their aim to visit the shrine of Shallya.
> 
> What do they do? I think Tasha is going to want to go without hesitation but I suspect Hadley and Elena will be more cautious. Hadley will be suspicious (as he always is) and will want to know who this person is. Elena will apply her intelligence and point out that this could all be just lucky guesses to support a ruse luring newcomers into trouble.
> 
> Is that what happens? Likely - 64 - Yes
> 
> Close! The threshold is 65!

Tasha is already looking inland, toward where the timber gives way to stone and the road climbs beyond the lower gate. “If someone is waiting at the shrine,” she says, “and needs my help, I shouldn’t delay.”

Hadley studies her a moment, then the road, then the press of strangers around them. “It’s near a full day’s walk to the shrine,” he says evenly. “And we’ve no idea who this ‘lady’ is. Or whether she exists at all.”

Elena’s voice comes from beneath her hood, quiet but clear. “It would be simple enough,” she says. “Watch the boats. Mark the pilgrims. Send a child with a story.” Her gaze shifts toward the gate. “A ruse like that could draw newcomers out of the city and into empty ground in the wilderness. Easy prey.”

Tasha does not look away from the road. “Or someone truly needs help.”

> [!roll] Questions
> Berrin is very quiet. I wonder what he thinks. 
> 
> Does he know anything about this? Very Unlikely - 71 - No
> 
> He knows nothing about the "lady". Does he think it's a trap? 50/50 - 25 - Yes

Hadley turns slightly, his eyes settling on Berrin.

“You’re very quiet,” he says. “Thoughts?”

Berrin shifts his weight, uncomfortable under the attention. He glances at Hadley and then briefly at Tasha.

“I don’t know any lady by the willow,” he says at last. “There are cottages along that road, aye. Some old, some near falling in. But no one of note. No one I’ve heard talk of.”

He hesitates, then with a glance at Tasha he adds more quietly, “Doesn’t mean she’s not there of course. Just means I've not heard talk of her.”

His jaw tightens. “If it were me, I’d be careful. The shrine road gets rough once you’re past the farms. Overgrown. Not many eyes on it. Easy enough place to… arrange things.” He swallows. “If someone wanted to draw you out of the city, that’d be where they’d do it.”

He looks at Tasha, not unkindly. “Doesn’t mean it is a trap. But it could be.”

Tasha frowns, her eyes gazing at the road. Before she can speak, Hadley says quietly - "Look - there's no sense in standing here trying to decide. I'm soaked through and need a hot bath and an ale to revive me. I daresay all of us could use a good meal after Captain Valqir's shipboard food. I say we are least get some rest at this tavern friend Berrin knows and then make a decision. We're heading for the shrine anyway - this is just about how we get there."

Tasha looks at him, her face worried - "But the summons - she's says we must not delay."

"A few hours aren't going to make a difference Tasha." Hadley holds up his sodden arm, "I can't travel dressed like a drowned rat."

"I agree." Elena's voice is soft but firm. "We have nothing to lose by preparing ourselves. There is no sense in running blindly into possible danger when we could be more considered."

> [!roll] Questions
> Hadley is being pretty convincing here. I think Tasha will agree with him but let's roll to see. Even he fails to convince her, I think she'll probably still agree to him cleaning up and them having a quick meal. Let's see.
> 
> Hadley's Charisma is 9 - not great. I'm going to give him a -2 bonus on the roll for being super convincing.
> 
> Hadley CHA - 2 - With the -2 bonus, that's a hefty success.
> 
> I think Hadley's aim would be to spend a night here and set out in the morning.

Hadley lets the silence sit for a moment, then nods once.

“If someone truly needs help,” he says, “they’ve waited this long. We won’t serve them by stumbling out half-prepared and half-seen.” He gestures back toward the city. “We take a room. We rest. We ask quiet questions about this willow house. At first light, we ride out properly.”

Tasha holds his gaze. The road inland still draws her, but reason tempers the urgency. After a moment, she exhales.

“Very well,” she says. “We go at dawn.”

Elena inclines her head slightly. “Morning light gives fewer places to hide,” she says. “And more time to read what waits for us.”

The decision is made. The shrine road will still be there at first light. For now, Kethryn closes in around them, and the Hunting Heron with it's hot baths and hot food awaits.

> [!roll] Questions
> I'll end the scene there. An interesting mystery. Who is this "lady" of the willow tree? Is she real, or just a ploy by petty thieves? Maybe we'll find out next time...
