title: S01E02 - The Wharf Road
summary: Berrin leads them away from the waterside at a careful pace, favouring his good leg as he threads them through the press of the docks. They pass between stacked crates and drying racks, past market stalls, haggling merchants and crews unloading cargos. No one pays them any heed now; the moment has passed, absorbed by the harbour’s constant motion.
