I'm using a few house rules while playing, several inspired by (or pinched from) sources such as [Tale of the Manticore].

- No fudging dice _ever_ - the rolls always stand
- Critical fumble results in missing your next turn
- First level characters automatically get maximum hit points - they don't need to roll.
- When rolling first level characters, roll 3d6 for 6 stats and then arrange them as you wish.
