First a huge caveat. I'm no B/X or OSE expert. I've played a good bit of D&D and a few other systems but I'm *very* far from being an RPG luminary like [Mike Shea] or [Matt Mercer]. Part of the enjoyment is going to be learning a new (old!) system but I'm highly likely to make mistakes. Hopefully I notice and don't make them a second time, but you never know!

I've decided to use a few house rules and mechanics while playing, inspired by (or pinched from) sources such as [Tale of the Manticore]. I'm intending to keep this article up to date with any new or modified rules I might adopt in the future.

## Rules

- No fudging dice _ever_ - the rolls always stand
- Critical fumble results in missing your next turn
- First level characters automatically get maximum hit points - they don't need to roll.
- When rolling first level characters, roll 3d6 for 6 stats in order. Two stats can then be swapped if desired.

## Oracles

I'll be using the d20 Oracle and Oracle prompt tables from [Solodark]. The d20 Oracle works like this:

- Ask a yes/no question (I tend to ask my questions with the dramatic outcome being a yes result)
- Roll d20
- 1 to 9 is a Yes
- 11 to 20 is a No
- 10 is an Unexpected Twist
- If the result is an odd number add "but..."
- 1 is an extreme No, 20 is an extreme Yes

Likely / unlikely checks are modelled with advantage / disadvantage on the roll. The oracle is fast, easy and fits nicely with the OSE dice pool. The [Solodark] Oracle tables are themed well for OSE as well and, at least for the moment, they fit the theme of the Twelve Duchies.
