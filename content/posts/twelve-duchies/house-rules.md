First a huge caveat. I'm no B/X or OSE expert. I've played a good bit of D&D and a few other systems but I'm *very* far from being an RPG luminary like [Mike Shea] or [Matt Mercer]. Part of the enjoyment is going to be learning a new (old!) system but I'm highly likely to make mistakes. Hopefully I notice and don't make them a second time, but you never know!

I've decided to use a few house rules and mechanics while playing, inspired by (or pinched from) sources such as [Tale of the Manticore]. I'm intending to keep this article up to date with any new or modified rules I might adopt in the future.

## Rules

- No fudging dice _ever_ - the rolls always stand
- Critical fumble results in missing your next turn
- First level characters automatically get maximum hit points - they don't need to roll.
- When rolling first level characters, roll 3d6 for 6 stats in order. Two stats can then be swapped if desired.

## Oracles

I'm going to use the [Mythic GM Emulator] for my oracle, meaning tables and so on. I'm not going to use the chaos factor and will probably determine random events based on spark words from the meaning tables rather then rolling on the events table. I may or may not keep thread and character lists - I'll see how I get on.
