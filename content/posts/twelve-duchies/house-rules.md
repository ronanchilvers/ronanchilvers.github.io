I'm using a few house rules and mechanics while playing, inspired by (or pinched from) sources such as [Tale of the Manticore]. I'm intending to keep this article up to date with any new or modified rules I might adopt in the future.

## Rules

- No fudging dice _ever_ - the rolls always stand
- Critical fumble results in missing your next turn
- First level characters automatically get maximum hit points - they don't need to roll.
- When rolling first level characters, roll 3d6 for 6 stats and then arrange them as you wish.

## Oracles

I'll be using the d20 Oracle and Oracle prompt tables from [Solodark]. The d20 Oracle works like this:

- Ask a yes/no question (I tend to ask my questions with the dramatic outcome being a yes result)
- Roll d20
- 1 to 9 is a Yes
- 11 to 20 is a No
- 10 is an Unexpected Twist
- If the result is an odd number add "but..."
- 1 is an extreme No, 20 is an extreme Yes

Likely / unlikely checks are modelled with advantage / disadvantage on the roll. The oracle is fast, easy and fits nicely with the OSE dice pool. The [Solodark] Oracle tables are themed well for OSE as well and, at least for the moment, they fit the theme of the Twelve Duchies.
