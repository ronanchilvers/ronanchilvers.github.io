A few months ago, after reading about Daggerheart's Duality Dice mechanic, I became quite excited by the idea of a solo play RPG engine which generated complications as a result of the characters action rolls. I like systems which use multiple facets of a single dice roll to create interesting outcomes, and the idea of a system which could generate both success and complications or twists in a single roll really appealed to me. 

Enter *Promise & Peril*.

The ruleset is intended as a very lightweight RPG, aimed at solo play, which uses two six-sided dice to resolve actions. It includes a tag based sytem for character creation, points pools which the player can use to influence the narrative and a simple oracle.
