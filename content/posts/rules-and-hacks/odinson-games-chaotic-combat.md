[Odinson Games] published an article yesterday with a table designed to inject [more chaos and drama] into combat. At the end of each round you roll on a random table to generate a chaotic event - anything from slipping and falling in bloodied mud to gaining the upper hand and giving advantage to an ally. It's a great idea - I foretell some customised tables popping up at my table!

You can read all about Odinson's chaotic combat idea on their substack. Go and grab yourself some random chaos!
