The Year Zero Engine is very flexible and I like the fact that it uses six sided dice, the most common kind. However, once you get an attribute and skill going you can rapidly end up rolling a _lot_ of them! In our first play test, being able to roll lots of dice easily was a sticking point, especially given the Streetwise Scene Strain mechanic (rather like Stress in [Alien RPG]).

In the end, to make play testing more streamlined, I put together a quick dice roller based on 5he current state of the Streetwise Core Rules. It's a work in progress but you can have a go at:
