title: A Streetwise Dice Roller

summary: The Year Zero Engine is very flexible and I like the fact that it uses
  six sided dice, the most common size. However, once you get an attribute and a
  skill going with possibly a modifier or two you can rapidly end up rolling a
  _lot_ of them!

The Year Zero Engine is very flexible and I like the fact that it uses six sided dice, the most common size. However, once you get an attribute and a skill going with possibly a modifier or two you can rapidly end up rolling a _lot_ of them! In our first play test, being able to roll lots of dice easily was a sticking point, especially given the Streetwise Scene Strain mechanic (rather like Stress in [Alien RPG]) where rolling Banes (1s) can add dice to future pools for everyone.

In the end, to make play testing more streamlined, I put together a quick dice roller based on the current state of the Streetwise Core Rules. It's a work in progress but you can have a go at:
