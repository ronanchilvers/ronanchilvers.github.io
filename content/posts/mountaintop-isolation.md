One of my favourite radio shows from the dim and distant past was [Nightfall](https://archive.org/details/CBC_NightfallOTR), creepy and disturbing stories of all sorts that used the power of radio and imagination to tell terrifying tales. The series often explored themes of isolation, loneliness and confusion with protagonists unsure what was going on or who they could trust. Characters were plunged into unfamiliar situations where the normal conveniences of life were out of reach. I've always enjoyed these stories as they tell us about a world outside our normal lives where the mysterious becomes tangible. This is a big part of the reason why I enjoy role playing games of all sorts - they give you a chance to live in other worlds, unchained from reality, where anything can happen.

Recently I listened to some episodes of [A Game of One's Own](https://snazzytapir.com/581-2/podcasts/a-game-of-ones-own/) where the host [Maddy Searle](https://snazzytapir.com/581-2/about/) plays through a solo journalling game named [Mountaintop Isolation](https://lalionnepublishing.itch.io/mountaintop-isolation). As the introduction to the game says

> You have been invited to a ski cabin weekend with your old high school friends. It is late at night by the time you find your way high up on the mountain to the remote cabin, and you are the first to arrive. You fall asleep by the crackling fire you built with the few logs available inside. When you wake up, the fire has died down to embers and you hear a whistling noise outside. A glance out the window reveals a whiteout blizzard that has created 4- to 6-foot drifts of snow. There is no cell phone reception, and the landline in the cabin appears to no longer workâ€¦

I was immediately drawn into the character's situation - why are they there? how do they handle the increasingly bleak outlook? what do they discover in the cabin? The huge appeal of GM-less play is that, as a player, you can be surprised by your own imagination. A prompt or two can lead to twists and turns that would never have appeared if you had set out from the start to plan the story. GM-less play gives us a chance to explore our own imagination and experience a story exactly tailored to how we think.

I'll be journalling a play through of Mountaintop Isolation as soon as I can. Watch this (spooky) space!
