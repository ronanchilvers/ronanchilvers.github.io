I was recently sorting out a load of old paperwork and made a fabulous discovery. Buried in a pile of stuff that I've not looked at in years, I found two maps that I created way back when my D&D adventures in other worlds had just begun. One was a world map and the other a map of one of the main continents named "The Twelve Duchies".

Tucked in between the two sheets of paper was a short bit of fiction I wrote - the start of an adventure in my own world.
