I was recently sorting out a load of old paperwork and made a fabulous discovery. Buried in a pile of stuff that I've not looked at in years, I found two maps that I created way back when my D&D adventures in other worlds had just begun. One was a world map and the other a map of one of the main continents named "The Twelve Duchies".

Tucked in between the two sheets of paper was a short bit of fiction I wrote - the start of an adventure in my own world. A tired, world weary innkeeper with a past, an enthusiastic young cleric and a pursued elven woman all made an appearance in the first few pages. Exciting stuff! I never played a game in this world however. Over the last few years I've been getting more and more into playing RPGs solo. A light bulb moment - why not roll up some characters and go adventuring in this world that my far younger self dreamed up!

I've been listening to the excellent [Tale of the Manticore](https://www.taleofthemanticore.com/) recently and have been itching to try out a bit of B/X D&D. As luck would have it I bought a [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) deal some time ago which included the player and referee tomes for [Old School Essentials](https://necroticgnome.com/pages/about-old-school-essentials) - perfect for a foray into the Twelve Duchies.

I'm intending to post short actual play write ups here as I wander this world from my last self's imagination. What wonders, monsters, dangers and treasures did I leave for my future self to discover!?
