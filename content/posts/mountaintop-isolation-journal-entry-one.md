Wow! This place is amazing! It took a while to get here - snow on the roads and it's pretty remote. Google maps took me the wrong way and I ended up at a gate on a cliff - had to find my own way for the last hour or so. There's no road the last quarter mile - had to leave the car and hike it. But the views! Wow wow! The cabin is just on the edge of a forest and looks out across the mountains - just stunning.

There's no one else here yet - I suppose I did leave pretty early to get here sooner so the others will still be a little while. It does mean if get to choose my room first! Hooray!

It's pretty cold so I'm going to light a fire (there's a big, old style fireplace) and get warm. Might crack open one of the bottles of wine I brought too - why not!?

Time to settle in - this is going to be a great weekend!
