## Evening

I'm really hungry. Just been rooting about in the cupboards and found a few things. A packet of stale biscuits (ate them - they were ok, better than nothing) and a deck of cards. There was a note with the deck of cards that looks like it's the scores for a game - one player seems to have done really well. The creepy thing is that someone ( I suppose the loser) has written "I'll beat you next time" on the paper - really scrawled and scratched it, even tore the paper a bit. I probably wouldn't have found it creepy if I hadn't heard that weird laughing in the forest. I keep opening the door and listening but there's nothing out there. Nothing I can see anyway.

When I was searching the forest around the cabin for the laughing (slowly, as my ankle is really painful!) I think I saw what might be a trail down the mountain. It's filled with snow but it looks like a game trail or something. It seemed to go in the right direction at least. It's getting dark again now so I can't follow it but at first light I'm going to see where it leads.  It might be a way out. God, I really hope so!

## Late evening

Ok, something really strange just happened. I was by the fire. The wind has dropped a bit and I've managed to block up the hole in the roof a bit more so I was actually feeling a little warmer. There was a lull in the wind and that's when I heard it - a soft tap tapping on the cabin door. I couldn't believe it - thought I was hearing things! I called out and tried to run to the door but forgot about my ankle. My foot just gave way and I went sprawling. Managed to get up and get to the door but when I opened it there was no one there. I know that sounds crazy but I'm sure someone was knocking on the door. I'm sure of it.

I'm starting to feel really scared. All this creepy stuff is happening, I'm can't call anyone, I can't get through the snow to the car (which is probably buried anyway), I have no food, the firewood is running low. This is a bad situation and every hour it seems to get worse.

I'm starting to feel like I might not make it out of here.
