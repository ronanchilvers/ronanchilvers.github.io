I'm really hungry. Just been rooting about in the cupboards and found a few things. A packet of stale biscuits (ate them - they were ok and better than nothing) and a deck of cards. There was a note with the deck of cards that looks like it's the scores for a game - one player seems have done really well. The creepy thing is that someone ( I suppose the loser) has written "I'll beat you next time" on the paper - really scrawled and scratched it, tearing the paper as they did so. I probably wouldn't have found it creepy if I hadn't heard that weird laughing in the forest. I keep opening the door and listening but there's nothing out there. Nothing I can see anyway.
