## Evening

I'm really hungry. Just been rooting about in the cupboards and found a few things. A packet of stale biscuits (ate them - they were ok and better than nothing) and a deck of cards. There was a note with the deck of cards that looks like it's the scores for a game - one player seems have done really well. The creepy thing is that someone ( I suppose the loser) has written "I'll beat you next time" on the paper - really scrawled and scratched it, tearing the paper as they did so. I probably wouldn't have found it creepy if I hadn't heard that weird laughing in the forest. I keep opening the door and listening but there's nothing out there. Nothing I can see anyway.

When I was searching the forest around the cabin for the laughing (slowly as my ankle is really painful!) I saw what might be a trail down the mountain. It's pretty filled with snow but it might be a game trail or something - it seemed to go in the right direction at least. It's getting dark again now so I can't follow it but at first light I'm going to see where it leads.  It might be a way out of here.

## Late evening

Ok, something really strange just happened. I was by the fire. The wind has dropped a bit and I've managed to block up the hole in the roof a bit more so I was actually feeling a little warmer. There was a lull in the wind and that's when I heard it - a soft tap tapping on the cabin door. I couldn't believe it - thought I was hearing things! I called out and tried to run to the door but forgot about my ankle. It just gave way and I went sprawling, I managed to get up and get to the door but when I opened it... well... there was no one there.
