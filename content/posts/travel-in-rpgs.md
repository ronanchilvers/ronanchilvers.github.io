title: Travelling in Role Playing Games
summary: In many classic novels, the journey is part (if not all) of the adventure. Yet in many games we handwave it, covering hundreds of miles of potentially adventurous terrain in moments. How can we make travel more exciting?

I think it's probably true to say that in most fantasy novels, travel is a crucial part of the story. Characters move through their worlds or into other worlds, undertaking arduous journeys with great risk and meeting various perils and problems along the way. Frodo and Sam's trek across Middle Earth to Mordor, Waylander's flight from the appalling were-creatures, Rand Al'Thor and his friends trekking through many dangers from Emond's Field to the White Tower and beyond. All of these journeys were not only the focus of story - they were the central plot device.
