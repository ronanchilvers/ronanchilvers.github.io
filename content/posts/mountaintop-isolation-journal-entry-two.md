Man it's cold!!! I must have fallen asleep last night. The fire's almost out and it looks like the snow really came down during the night as there are 6 foot drifts outside. It's around 6am I think - still dark. I'm going to have to get some more wood in at some point - I put the last couple of logs on the fire a few minutes ago.

There's no one else here. I tried ringing Matt, and Ellie as well, but there's no signal. I'm guessing that the snowfall has given them a load of hassle getting here. I might hike back to the car once it's light and see if there's any sign of them - they'll probably need help getting bags and stuff through the drifts - Ellie and Sam always bring too much stuff!!!

I'm glad I won't be on my own up here. It's beautiful but it feels like I'm on the edge of the wilds, kind of unwelcome. Strange feeling.

I read about some hikers a few years ago who got lost on the trails on these mountains during snow season. They were never seen again. I suppose there are still wild places where humans aren't welcome.
