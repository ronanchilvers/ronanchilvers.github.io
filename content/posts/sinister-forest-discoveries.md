I often have the need for strange, non-combat discoveries that characters can stumble across on their way somewhere. This list is intended for use in mysterious forests, such as Davokar from Free League's [Symbaroum](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/shop/symbaroum/)

1.  A circle of weathered stones covered in strange runes
2.  A fleeting shadow that appears just out of sight, always leading the characters deeper into the forest
3.  A small stream that seems to whisper secrets as it flows
4.  A grove filled with bioluminescent mushrooms that pulse with light
5.  An overgrown shrine dedicated to an unknown deity
6.  A cave that echoes back the characters' words in strange, distorted ways
7.  Mysterious lanterns that float through the air, leading the characters to a hidden path
8.  A massive footprint in the ground, leading deeper into the forest
9.  A massive fallen tree with a hollow trunk within which is a hidden cache of items including maps, notes, or magical artifacts
10.  A thick fog that rolls in unexpectedly, obscuring vision and altering sounds
11.  A small, crystal-clear pool that reflects not only the characters' images but also their deepest desires
12.  A tree with bark that shifts in colors and patterns, hung with many strange items, with leaves that are viciously sharp and sway endlessly around the trunk
13.  A gentle breeze that carries soft whispers
14.  A patch of vibrant blood-red flowers that seem to pulse with a life of their own
15.  A gnarled tree that appears to be weeping sap that resembles tears
16.  A collection of bones hanging from the branches of a tree, each one etched with strange symbols
17.  A thick fog that rolls in unexpectedly, filled with whispers of past mistakes and regrets
18.  An abandoned campsite with a smoldering fire that never fully extinguishes
19.  A grave marked by a simple stone, overgrown with vines
20.  A haunting melody that echoes through the trees, sung by a spectral figure
