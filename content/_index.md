This is a blog about tabletop roleplaying games—the kind of stories we tell, the systems that shape them, and the little moments that make them memorable. You’ll find thoughts on playstyles, GM tricks, homebrew ideas, and reflections on games old and new. I love exploring different systems, from rules-light indie RPGs to crunchy classics, because every game has something interesting to teach.

If any of that sounds fun to you, feel free to poke around. Thanks for stopping by, and happy gaming.

(Extra points if you’re reading this with dice in your pocket.)
