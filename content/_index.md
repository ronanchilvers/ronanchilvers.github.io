title: Ronan's Blog - Bits and Pieces

This is a little blog about tabletop roleplaying games (mostly). You’ll find (eventually) thoughts on playstyles, homebrew stuff, and reflections on games old and new. I hugely enjoy exploring different systems, from rules-light indie RPGs to crunchy classics, and using them to fertilise my own ideas.

I also have some [actual play](/tags/actual-play/) write ups for various games. I enjoy solo and cooperative games as well as the traditional GM led style and I keep notes, etc around for posterity in my own head, if not anyone else's!

If any of that sounds fun to you, feel free to poke around. Thanks for stopping by, and happy gaming.
