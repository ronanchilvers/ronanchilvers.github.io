I have three characters already, taken from the fiction that I wrote years ago. I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with a sort of solo session zero and outline a bit about them. I&amp;rsquo;m being intentionally brief - I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend too much time on it as I&amp;rsquo;d rather details emerge through the story.</description></item><item><title>Victorian Street Urchins</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/11/victorian-street-urchins/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/11/victorian-street-urchins/</guid><description>A Year Zero Engine hack for street urchin adventures in victorian London.</description></item><item><title>Monster Random Tactics</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/11/monster-random-tactics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/11/monster-random-tactics/</guid><description>The amazing and fabulous Ironsworn and it&amp;rsquo;s sci-fi siblings Starforged and Sundered Isles have fantastic sets of random tables with which to seed chaos into your adventures.</description></item><item><title>House Rules</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/11/house-rules/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/11/house-rules/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m using a few house rules and mechanics while playing, inspired by (or pinched from) sources such as Tale of the Manticore.</description></item><item><title>Odinson Games Chaotic Combat</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/11/odinson-games-chaotic-combat/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/11/odinson-games-chaotic-combat/</guid><description>Injecting more crazy into combat</description></item><item><title>S1E0 - The Discovery</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/11/the-discovery/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/11/the-discovery/</guid><description>An actual play experiment with D&amp;amp;D OSE</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Five</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/06/journal-entry-five/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/06/journal-entry-five/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m really hungry. Just been rooting about in the cupboards and found a few things.

The day started so well! Managed to get the fire going and it lasted until first light, around 8am. The dawn was spectacular - the cabin must be facing southeast because the sun rose over the mountains away to the left.</description></item><item><title>Journal Entry Two</title><link>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/06/journal-entry-two/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 00:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ronanchilvers.github.io/2025/06/journal-entry-two/</guid><description>Man it&amp;rsquo;s cold!!!

This place is amazing! It took a while to get here - snow on the roads and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty remote.
