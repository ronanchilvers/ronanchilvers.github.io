He binds his slashed arm with a makeshift bandage from his room, a torn piece of his oldest shirt, gripping it with his teeth to pull it tight. The rain beats hard against the upper windows of the tavern and thunder rolls in the distance. He checks the elf again, satisfying himself that she is breathing. The elf is pale, her breathing shallow. Hadley frowns - she needs help and quickly.</p><p>He descends the stairs slowly, hand on the rail, boots careful on broken shards of wood from the chairs. The orcs lie where they fell and he checks each in turn, waiting for breath that doesn&rsquo;t come, watching for the twitch that would mean trouble. Nothing. Just the sting of his arm and the storm.</p><p>In the kitchen and taproom, the lanterns have been blown out and the tavern is in sodden darkness. The front door hangs off its hinges, rain gusting in across the threshold. One window is smashed, glass glittering crunching underfoot.</p><p>He moves to the doorway and peers out. Wind forces sheets of rain down the lane outside, thunder, coming closer. He peers into the night for movement, listens hard for anything out of place in the raging storm. Further down the lane he can see a few lights from other buildings - houses, the small temple to Shallya where a light in the darkness always burns. He holds for a long breath, then another, making sure the danger has passed, for the moment at least.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--mechanics"><h4 class=alert__title>Questions</h4><div class=alert__content><p>I&rsquo;m reluctant to ask the Oracle whether any other orcs are abroad in the night but I think I have
to. I think there must be some nearby - it&rsquo;s unlikely that the two he killed are the only ones. These
two were clearly driven enough to venture into town and attack a tavern so I imagine there&rsquo;s
some significant need. On the other hand, they would be taking a huge risk to send more -
possibly these two were alone for stealth. It feels like a straight oracle roll would be appropriate.
Here it comes:</p><p>Are there any signs of other orcs? 14 - yes
What signs? 40 - Avoid, 78 - Safety</p><p>Eep!!</p></div></blockquote><p>A few hundred yards up the lane a figure moves in the darkness. With no attempt at stealth the future walks down the lane, through the storm, steadily making it&rsquo;s way towards the tavern. It is tall, broad, it&rsquo;s movements steady despite the wind.</p><p>It passes through the dim pool of light from a lit window. In that smear of light, steel flashes. It seems the figure carries a drawn sword.</p><p>Hadley mutters a curse, spitting on the tavern floor in frustration. He&rsquo;s been lucky so far but his luck can&rsquo;t hold and he&rsquo;s been away from fighting for too long to make his own luck.</p><p>He turns from the doorway and runs, boots thudding on wet floorboards. Through the dark kitchen, up the stairs two at a time, one hand on the rail. His bandaged arm burns, but he keeps moving. The bodies of the two orcs have filled the stairwell with their stink and he takes a moment to haul them aside by their belts, clearing the stairs a little.</p><p>He drops down beside the elf. &ldquo;Miss! Miss!!&rdquo; He touches her face, shakes her shoulder, listening for breath. &ldquo;Come on! Wake up! We have to move!&rdquo;</p><blockquote class="alert alert--mechanics"><h4 class=alert__title>Questions</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Yikes! They don&rsquo;t have much time before the orc (or maybe orcs?!?) arrive. I think I&rsquo;m going to use a progress clock to track the approach of the new orc / orcs. I need to work out h9w far away the orc is. I&rsquo;ll roll 4d6 and multiply by 10 to get the distance&mldr;</p><p>Roll - 14</p><p>At 140 yards, it&rsquo;s not far away but it isn&rsquo;t running so I&rsquo;ll use a 4 segment clock. When it feels appropriate I&rsquo;ll roll a &ldquo;likely&rdquo; Oracle check to see if it&rsquo;s any closer.</p><p>Clock - 0/4 segments</p><p>I will give Elena a CON check to see if she wakes up. Her CON is 10 so she&rsquo;ll need less than that on a d20 to succeed. Rolling&mldr;</p><p>Elena CON - 20!</p><p>Eeshk! Elena is out cold. Since that is a critical failure, I will rule that she won&rsquo;t be waking up any time soon and won&rsquo;t be allowed any more CON checks until things change significantly.</p></div></blockquote><p>The elf&rsquo;s eyes are closed, her face pale in the gloom - no response. Hadley swears under his breath. He hesitates for a moment and then, pulling her into a sitting position, he braces himself to haul her into his shoulder.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Questions</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Now then&mldr; Previously (last chapter) Hadley was able to drag Elena up the stairs without needing a STR check. I probably should have made him roll there <em>but</em> he was just dragging her and his adrenaline was singing. In this situation though, dragging is no good. He has to not only pick her up, but also carry her down the stairs, out of the tavern and down the lane <em>in a hurry</em>. A STR check is needed I think. Hadley has a STR stat of 14. Here we go&mldr;</p><p>Hadley STR - 19</p></div></blockquote><p>He tries to haul her onto his shoulder but she&rsquo;s a dead weight. His arm, weakened by the sword cut, shakes as he tries to lift her and after a moment he lets her slide back to the floor. He swears repeatedly under his breath - he can almost feel the orc boots in the mud of the lane drawing inexorably closer.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Questions</h4><div class=alert__content><p>We need to do a clock check.</p><p>Is the orc closer to the tavern? Likely - <del>4</del> ,17 - Yes but&mldr;</p><p>Eep! A segment filled. However, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;but&mldr;&rdquo; there. I think the orc has slowed - maybe it&rsquo;s being cautious, looking out for the other two.</p><p>Clock - 1/4</p></div></blockquote><p>He slumps down next to her, breathing hard, leaning back against the wall. He reaches over and gently smooths the hair away from the elf&rsquo;s face, his touch kind. He pulls her cloak around her as best he can.</p><p>&ldquo;Alright&mldr; alright&mldr; You rest for a while&mldr;&rdquo; For a moment his mind drifts back, remembering.</p><p><em>He is young, breath hot in his throat. Boots drum the churned field as he runs with the others. Ahead, orcs in their hundreds form a dark, ragged front. Drums thud. He tastes metal and fear.</em></p><p><em>They crush into a line, shields edge to edge. Wet stings his eyes. The charge comes, bowstrings snap, then the crash. An orc slams his shield, rank breath, broken teeth. He drives the point of his sword low; it bites; his arm shakes. Someone at his shoulder screams and keeps screaming.</em></p><p><em>The press shoves him sideways. He slips, knees in mud, a boot grinds his hand. He claws up, spine burning, and meets another blade, parries by luck. The world narrows to breath, weight, steel. He does not think; he does not plan; he stands because the ones beside him do.</em></p><p>Hadley breathes deep, is still for a moment and then clambers wearily to his feet. The sword cut in his arm throbs painfully. He looks down at the elf, pale in the gloom, her breathing shallow.</p><p>&ldquo;Back in a few minutes.&rdquo; He turns and moves to the stairwell, listening carefully. Then he begins to make his way down in the dark.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Questions</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Another clock check is needed. Since the previous check was a &ldquo;Yes but&mldr;&rdquo; and I guessed that the orc has slowed it&rsquo;s pace. I&rsquo;m going to rule that this will be a &ldquo;50/50&rdquo; Oracle check instead of a &ldquo;Likely&rdquo; one. Here we go&mldr;</p><p>Is the orc closer to the tavern? 50/50 - 17 - Yes but&mldr;</p><p>Ok - it is still moving closer but there&rsquo;s something else going on. I don&rsquo;t think I need to worry about stealth rolls for Hadley at this stage as the orc hasn&rsquo;t reached the tavern yet.</p></div></blockquote><p>Hadley creeps down the stairs, his heart thudding in his chest. The tavern is dark, the wind still whistling through the taproom from the smashed door and window. Hadley edges forwards into the kitchen, his heart in his mouth. Nothing. Just the creak of the front door swinging its hinges.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Questions</h4><div class=alert__content><p>I&rsquo;m not rolling to see if the orc has made progress yet - the persistent &ldquo;Yes but&mldr;&rdquo; answers before make me think that it has slowed considerably. Maybe it&rsquo;s waiting to see if the others emerge or for a signal of some sort.</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to check on the state of the storm to see if it&rsquo;s blowing itself out yet.</p><p>Is the storm abating? 16 - Yes</p></div></blockquote><p>As he moves through the kitchen, sword ready, he can see the wind and rain have lessened. The curtains round the smashed window are hanging in wet tatters, glass and wooden fragments from the frame littering the floor. The fire has gone out and Hadley shivers with the cold. He eases forwards slowly, peering around the door of the kitchen into the taproom towards the front door.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Questions</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Does he see anything? I&rsquo;m going to treat this like a Listen At Doors roll - Hadley has a 1 in 6 chance of hearing something. I&rsquo;m going to roll and if he does, I&rsquo;ll determine what it is.</p><p>Listen At Doors: 5 - No</p></div></blockquote><p>He hears and sees nothing but the tavern curtains blowing in the wind, the front door swinging back and forth with a creak - the orc must have bent the hinges. Slowly, carefully, he moves out of the kitchen towards the front door.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Questions</h4><div class=alert__content><p>I think I need to make a roll to see if the orc is any closer now. Hadley might see it through the doorway if it is. I&rsquo;m going to stay with the 50/50 odds though given the repeated &ldquo;Yes but&mldr;&rdquo; results.</p><p>Is the orc closer to the tavern? 18 - Yes</p><p>A clear &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; this time! So what was the orc delaying for? To meet some others? Maybe&mldr; I&rsquo;ll ask the Oracle as an open ended question. I&rsquo;ll use the prompt tables in Solodark.</p><p>Why did the orc delay?
47 - Lose, 23 - Doubt</p><p>Hmm&mldr; sounds like the orc was making sure of something. Making sure of where exactly it&rsquo;s companions had gone? It would see the smashed door and window fairly quickly - that would help it lose doubt!</p></div></blockquote><p>He squints through the battered door into the night. The wind has eased; rain falls steady, hissing on the step.</p><p>At first he sees nothing. The lane lies empty, the dark close and heavy.</p><p>A shape pulls loose from the deeper shadows. It moves toward the doorway, slow and sure.</p><p>The shape resolves: an orc, shoulders broad, tusked jaw. In its fist a wickedly curved axe hangs low, the edge dark with rain.
Fear stirs in Hadley, old and known, but he keeps his breath even.</p><p>He slips to the hinge side of the doorway, presses flat to the wall, blade low, and waits for it to cross the threshold.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Questions</h4><div class=alert__content><p>This is a surprise roll but only for the orc. According to the OSE rules, a combatant is surprised on a roll of 1 or 2 on a d6. Let&rsquo;s see&mldr;</p><p>Surprise roll for the orc: 2 - hooray!!</p></div></blockquote><blockquote class="alert alert--combat"><h4 class=alert__title>Combat</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Hadley is hiding behind the door and the orc <em>is</em> surprised so his ambush will work - he will get a one round advantage during which the orc cannot act. No need for initiative as we only have two combatants.</p><p>We need to work out the orc&rsquo;s hit points. According to the OSE Referee&rsquo;s Tome, orcs have 1 hit die or a static average of 4 hp. I&rsquo;ll give this orc 4hp.</p><p>I also need to think about Hadley&rsquo;s armour class. With his leather armour he would be AC 6. However he isn&rsquo;t wearing it. He still has his dexterity though so his AC is 8 for this combat.</p></div></blockquote><p>He is motionless in the shadow behind the door, breath held, blade tight in his good hand.</p><p>As the orc shoulders through the doorway, he leaps forward, cutting savagely for the neck and shoulder.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Round 1</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Hadley sword attack - THAC0 19, +1 STR - 17 for 3 damage</p></div></blockquote><p>Hadley&rsquo;s blade bites deep into the orc&rsquo;s shoulder and the creature roars in pain, staggering forwards as blood sprays from the wound. It spins to face Hadley, snarling in rage, it&rsquo;s axe whistling through the air.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Round 2</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Initiative - Hadley - 4, Orc - 2</p><p>Hadley sword attack - THAC0 19, +1 STR - 5+1 = 6</p><p>Orc axe attack - THAC0 19 - 6</p></div></blockquote><p>Hadley slashes for the wounded shoulder, but the orc jerks back and the blade hisses past. The axe whips in low and hard; he twists aside and it carves only wet floorboards. They square off in the doorway, breath harsh, rain dripping from steel.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Round 3</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Initiative - Hadley - 3, Orc - 4</p><p>This is scary. Hadley could be in serious trouble here. He&rsquo;s on 5 HP and the orc does 1d6 damage.</p><p>Orc axe attack - THAC0 19 - 12 for 4 damage - phew!!!</p><p>Hadley sword attack - THAC0 19, +1 STR - 11+1 = 2</p></div></blockquote><p>The axe hacks across his ribs; pain burns hot and he stumbles, breath punched out. Blood runs, but he keeps his feet. His return swing skids off the orc’s armour, a scrape with no bite, and he snaps back into guard.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Round 4</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Initiate - Hadley - 4, Orc - 6</p><p>Both Hadley and the orc are on 1 HP - the first to score a hit survives! Yikes!!!!</p><p>Orc axe attack - THAC0 19 - 2</p><p>Yes!!!! Come on Hadley!</p><p>Hadley sword attack - THAC0 19, +1 STR - 7+1 = 8</p><p>Damn!!!</p></div></blockquote><p>Steel crashes on steel; the axe whistles past and Hadley’s blade meets it, jarring his arm. Both combatants miss their mark, boots sliding on wet boards as they square up again.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Round 5</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Initiative - Hadley - 4, Orc - 2</p><p>Come on Hadley!!!</p><p>Hadley sword attack - THAC0 19, +1 STR - 4+1 = 5</p><p>Oh yikes!!! This could be it!!</p><p>Orc sword attack - THAC0 19 - 10</p><p>Oh sheesh!!! Just misses!!!</p></div></blockquote><p>His arm is heavy, blood slick at his side; his swing goes wide and misses. The orc’s axe whistles past, close enough to stir his hair and he staggers back, bringing his sword up. It feels leaden, his arms aching with the strain.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Round 6</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Initiative - Hadley - 3, Orc - 2</p><p>Come on Hadley! Just one hit is all you need!!</p><p>Hadley sword attack - THAC0 19, +1 STR - 2+1 = 3</p><p>Orc axe attack - THAC0 19 - 9</p><p>I don&rsquo;t believe it!! They are somehow still both on their feet!!!</p></div></blockquote><p>They slog in once more, swings slow and heavy. Hadley’s cut is clumsy and the orc’s axe swings wide. Steel finds only air. Blood spatters the boards as they square up yet again. They both know it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before one of them goes down.</p><blockquote class="alert alert--roll"><h4 class=alert__title>Round 7</h4><div class=alert__content><p>Initiative - Hadley - 2, Orc - 4</p><p>Orc axe attack - THAC0 19 - 18 for 3 damage</p><p>Oh no!!!!!!</p></div></blockquote><p>With fading strength the orc dips a shoulder, a clumsy feint, then smashes the axe in hard. It&rsquo;s enough. Hadley’s guard lifts; the blade bites low into his side and drives through. Heat flares, then cold. His sword slips from numb fingers and clatters. He folds to the floor, blood washing with rain in a thin red sheen across the boards.</p><p>He leans on the jamb, sliding down, breath fluttering, eyes on the wavering night beyond the door.</p><p><em>Firelight glows on a low ceiling. His mother stands at the hearth, wiping her hands on a cloth - dinner is ready. His father’s rough laugh fills the room and Hadley hears his name. His brother is already sitting at the long bench, pulling off his boots, beckoning him in. His father calls his name again. It&rsquo;s been a long journey.</em></p><p><em>The storm is far away here. No hurry, no pain. He sits, the wood familiar under him, the heat on his face. Those he loves are around him. He smiles, content. He is home, and it is enough.</em></p><p>He exhales once, shallow and final, and goes still.</p></article><section class=related><h2 class=related__title>Related Posts</h2><div class=cards><div class=card><figure class=card-image><a class=card-title href=/posts/2025/11/house-rules/>House Rules</a>
