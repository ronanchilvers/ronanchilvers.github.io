Rain drums on the window shutters and seeps through in thin threads that trickle down the glass. A few patrons hunch over their last mugs, voices low, the kind of talk that trails off rather than ends. Chairs creak. Someone laughs once, tired and hollow. The fire burns low in the grate, a charred log glowing among the embers.</p><p>The weather gnaws at him. It’s the wrong kind of cold—wet, chilling the bones. He thinks of the northern lands of the Duchies, the towns on the coast of Nemus. Winter there felt like a long autumn. Salt on the air. Wind that carried warmth even when the sun was pale. Evenings outside without a cloak, the world soft with mist rather than drenched with rains.</p><p>He breathes out a slow sigh and keeps wiping, one table, then the next. Coins clink on wood, benches and chairs scrape, boots scuff. The last patrons leave and the room is quiet but for the shifting of embers in the fireplace as the charred wood settles. Outside the storm rages. Hadley glances at the door, shut against against the wind and wonders how long the storm means to linger.</p><p>On the edge of town a cloaked figure stumbles, running through the rain, each step a dragging effort. Boots slip and splash in pooled water, the cloak hanging heavy with rain that falls relentlessly, stinging on wind chilled skin. The figure&rsquo;s every motion speaks of exhaustion.</p><p>Further up the road, two more figures run in the shadows, bent low against the downpour, faces hidden in the dark blur of rain. They close the distance with steadily, boots kicking up water.</p><p>The staggering figure lifts its head at the dull glow of lanterns leaking from the Dancing Bear&rsquo;s windows. Summoning whatever strength remains, the figure lurches toward the inn, slipping on mud, breath harsh and loud in the storm.</p><blockquote class="alert alert-roll"><h4>Questions</h4><div><p>The figure reaches the inn? - 13 / yes but&mldr;
Do they just burst in through the door? 4 / no</p></div></blockquote><p>Hadley dries and stacks the last tankards, his hand slowed by the ache in his knuckles. They never used to ache but they often do now. Probably the weather - old man Hassock told him last week that his knees pain him more during the winter storms.</p><p>The sudden crash on the door jerks him upright. He shouts, voice flat, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re closed!&rdquo; The hammering comes again, louder, frantic. He recognises panic - that&rsquo;s no drunk looking for a soak.</p><p>As he crosses the room to the door he checks his belt knife out of habit, hand resting on the worn hilt. Rain gusts in as he cracks the door. A cloaked figure surges past him and crashes to the boards, face first, drenched cloak spreading water across the floor.</p><p>Hadley glances at the night beyond before shutting the door hard against the storm. He keeps his hand on the knife, watching the heap of someone on the floor. Years of tavern keeping and, before that, of conflict, make him cautious.</p><p>A pink wash of blood seeps out from under the cloak, spreading slowly across the boards, thickening to red. The figure groans, the sound faint. Hand on the knife, Hadley leans down and rolls the new arrival onto their side, the hood still obscuring the face. The end of a crossbow bolt juts from the shoulder, blood seeping from the wound.</p><p>The hood slips back and Hadley stares. It&rsquo;s an elven woman, her face pale in the low light of the tavern, strained with pain. She wears torn traveling clothes and battered leather armour.</p><blockquote class="alert alert-roll"><h4>Questions</h4><div><p>Is the Elena conscious? - 12 / yes
Is she lucid? 7 / no</p></div></blockquote><p>The woman tries to sit up, tries to speak, words thin and hurried in a tongue he doesn&rsquo;t know. Her fingers clamp on his sleeve, knuckles white, fear and panic bright in her eyes. She forces herself up further and the bolt shifts; she cries out, the sound sharp and raw.</p><p>Hadley steadies her with a flat palm. &ldquo;Easy. Don&rsquo;t move - you&rsquo;ll make it worse. Just lie still.&rdquo; His voice stays low and even, the other hand near his belt. Rain drums at the door - the room smells of wet wood mixed with the metallic scent of blood. &ldquo;Stay still.&rdquo;</p><p>She sags back, breath shuddering. A shaking hand lifts, pointing at the door, blood smearing the fingers. Her mouth finds one word he understands before she goes slack, eyes rolling shut - &ldquo;Orcs!&rdquo;</p><p>Hadley stares mutely at her for a long moment. He turns and stepping to the door, turns the key in the lock. The rear door is already locked.</p><p>A flicker of movement catches his eye as he turns back to the elf, movement outside, more than just lashing rain. He dives aside, glass smashes and something thuds into the wall opposite the window. A crossbow bolt, black fletchings wet from the rain, shivers in the oak beam.</p><blockquote class="alert alert-combat"><h4>Combat</h4><div><p>Two orcs have followed the elf into Southome and are now outside the tavern.
Hadley narrowly missed being hit!</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to rule that the elf, Elena, gets a constitution check each round to see if
she wakes up. Her CON stat is 10 so she&rsquo;ll need to roll 10 or lower to succeed. The orcs
will initially be making Open Doors checks to break through the tavern doors. One is a leader
and will succeed on a 4,5 or 6, the other orc on just 5 or 6.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote class="alert alert-roll"><h4>Round 1</h4><div><p>Initiative - Hadley - 1, Orcs - 3
Elena CON - 12 - she&rsquo;s still unconscious
Orc 1 - Open Doors - 2
Orc 2 - Open Doors - 3</p></div></blockquote><p>Hadley grabs the elf under her arms. He drags her across the room and through the swing door into the kitchen. He hears a crash against the outside door and then another from the rear door of the tavern. The stout oak doors hold. Hadley pulls a barrel keg in front of the swing door and then scrambling across the room, he grabs a worn looking scabbard and sword that is hanging in the corner. Many&rsquo;s the time he thought about getting rid of it, of letting that previous version of him go - now he&rsquo;s glad he didn&rsquo;t.</p><blockquote class="alert alert-roll"><h4>Round 2</h4><div><p>Initiative - Hadley - 2, Orcs - 5
Elena CON - 14</p><p>I think the orcs will quickly become frustrated by the doors and will try other entrances. The
orc at the back door is very close to a window. I&rsquo;ll roll an oracle check to see if he tries
that instead</p><p>Result: 17 / yes but&mldr;</p><p>Since the result is qualified, I&rsquo;ll rule that the orc will have one more go at the door before
he tries the window.</p><p>Orc 1 - Open Doors - 3
Orc 2 - Open Doors - 4</p></div></blockquote><p>Crashes at both doors again but they hold. Hadley shakes the elf but she is unresponsive. Straining, he half lifts, half carries her through the kitchen door that leads to the stairs. He hauls her upwards, breathing hard, until he drags her through the door at the top and lets her slump to the floor.</p><blockquote class="alert alert-roll"><h4>Round 3</h4><div><p>Initiative - Hadley - 3, Orcs - 2
Elena CON - 12
Orc 1 - Open Doors - 5
Orc 1 has finally succeeded - that oak door put up a good fight!</p><p>Orc 2 has turned his attention to the window and is going to smash it and climb through. It
won&rsquo;t prove much of an obstacle so I&rsquo;ll do an Open Doors check to see how rapidly he
does it. Success (5 or 6) will mean he can climb through and move around a bit
inside, all in this round.
Orc 2 - Open Doors - 2</p></div></blockquote><p>Hadley half runs, half slides down the stairs to the kitchen. Out in the tavern there&rsquo;s simultaneously a sound of breaking timber and smashing glass. One of the doors has given way and it sounds like something is smashing it&rsquo;s way through a window at the back. Hadley grabs a chair from the corner and closing the kitchen door, jams it under the door handle. Then he turns and runs back up the stairs.</p><blockquote class="alert alert-roll"><h4>Round 4</h4><div><p>Initiative - Hadley - 1, Orcs - 6
Elena CON - 7</p></div></blockquote><p>Below in the main room, the smashed window and door create a funnel for the storm. The wind rages through the room, extinguishing lanterns and sending chairs scraping across the floor. Two figures, heavy and bulky move in the darkness, communicating with guttural grunts.</p><p>Their eyes follow the dark streak of the elf&rsquo;s blood across the floorboards and round to the swing door. The larger one shoves the door and finds it blocked - it grunts at it&rsquo;s companion, snout wrinkling and kicks the door hard.</p><p>On the stairs above Hadley drags two chairs to the stairwell and shoves them down it. Wood splinters as they tumble down, forming a loose barricade at the foot of the steps. He stands above, breathing hard, sword in hand - he can hear the swing door creak and bang as something hammers at it.</p><p>Behind him the elf stirs, her eyes unfocussed, blinking, as she tries to sit up.</p><blockquote class="alert alert-roll"><h4>Round 5</h4><div><p>Initiative - Hadley - 6, Orcs - 2
Orc 1 - Open Doors - 4</p></div></blockquote><p>Hadley darts to his small room under the eaves. He grabs his old bow from the shadowed corner, heavy and scarred, made not for hunting but for war. Quiver slung, he runs back to the landing, arrow nocked, bow half drawn and waits, breath steady. Below, the kitchen door gives way with a heavy crack—splinters scatter as the orcs force their way through and into the stairwell.</p><blockquote class="alert alert-roll"><h4>Round 6</h4><div><p>Initiative - Hadley - 5, Orcs - 2</p><p>The stairwell is blocked by the chairs that Hadley through down it. I will
rule that is enough to slow the orcs to half speed meaning they will need
to spend this whole round clambering over the wreckage.</p><p>Hadley missile attack - THAC0 19 - 15+1+1=17 for 5 damage
The orc leader has 8 hit points - Hadley&rsquo;s arrow brings that down to 3. A good shot!</p></div></blockquote><p>Elena is behind Hadley, struggling to rise, blinking through the pain. He hisses, &ldquo;Stay down - they&rsquo;re in the stairwell.&rdquo; Hadley waits as the larger orc shoves chairs aside with guttural curses.</p><p>When the orc leader hauls himself over the last splintered chair, Hadley leans out, draws, and looses. The arrow thuds deep into the orc’s shoulder. The beast roars, rage and pain mixed with shock.</p><p>Elena claws her way upright, breath ragged. Knees shaking, she draws a dagger, knuckles white around the hilt.</p><blockquote class="alert alert-roll"><h4>Round 7</h4><div><p>Initiative - Hadley - 1
Hadley missile attack - THAC0 19 - 18+1+1 = 20 for 2 damage
Orc 1 sword attack - THAC0 19 - 1 / critical fumble</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to give Hadley a small armour class bonus as he&rsquo;s well prepared and
is able to use the doorway as cover - I&rsquo;ll give him a +2 bringing his AC to 7.</p><p>I&rsquo;m also going to adopt a rule from Tale of the Manticore. Rolling a critical
fumble (a 1) results in losing your attack in the next round of combat. The
orc leader will be unable to attack next round. Lucky!
Hadley&rsquo;s attack however hits - the leader is down to 1 hit point</p></div></blockquote><p>The orc leader heaves himself over the tangled barricade of chairs, bellowing as he grasps the shaft of the arrow in his shoulder and snaps it off. Hadley looses again. The shaft whistles through the close air, striking the orc just below the ribs. The brute staggers, snarling, then charges up the cramped stair, roaring with blood and spittle spraying from his mouth.</p><p>The orc swings wide, sword flashing. Steel bites air—Hadley steps back, the blade missing by inches. Behind, the second orc claws for a path but can&rsquo;t force his bulk past his companion.</p><p>Elena, still slumped against the landing wall, presses the dagger to her chest with shaking hands. Her vision blurs with pain and she feels blood trickling down her arm, but she lifts the blade, ready to strike at anything that comes close.</p><blockquote class="alert alert-roll"><h4>Round 8</h4><div><p>Initiative - Hadley - 1, Orcs - 4</p><p>Hadley is in face to face combat now. He doesn&rsquo;t have his leather
armour and he&rsquo;s no longer able to duck behind the door so his AC is 9. Thank
goodness for that critical fumble!</p><p>The orc leader misses his turn on this round.
Hadley sword attack - THAC0 19 - 3+1+1 = 4</p></div></blockquote><p>The orc leader tries to regain his footing on the narrow stairs, snarling at Hadley. Muscle and rage drive him upright. Hadley slashes down at him, but the orc bats the blade aside with a thick forearm. The ring of steel is sharp and close.</p><p>Elena hugs the wall, breath sharp and hollows deep under her eyes. She shudders with fatigue and pain, dread coiling in her mind. Capture means death, or worse.</p><blockquote class="alert alert-roll"><h4>Round 9</h4><div><p>Initiative - Hadley - 5, Orcs - 1
Hadley sword attack - THAC0 19 - 14+1+1 = 16 for 5 damage</p><p>Hadley&rsquo;s final thrust hits home - the orc leader is dead. One left to deal with!</p></div></blockquote><p>The orc leader&rsquo;s sword whistles through the air toward Hadley&rsquo;s head. Hadley ducks and drives his blade upward, the steel punching through flesh and bone. The leader dies with a wheezing groan and slumps on the stairs.</p><p>The second orc shrieks in rage. Shoving his leader’s corpse aside, he leaps at Hadley, his curved blade whistling in an cruel arc.</p><blockquote class="alert alert-roll"><h4>Round 10</h4><div><p>Initiative - Hadley - 2, Orc - 4
Orc sword attack - THAC0 19 - 19 for 4 damage
Hadley sword attack - THAC0 19 - 18+1+1 = 20 for 8 damage</p></div></blockquote><p>Hadley isn’t quick enough. The orc’s blade slashes across his forearm and Hadley grunts in shock - it&rsquo;s a long time since he felt the pain of a sword cut. The creature roars in triumph at the blood on its blade.</p><p>Hadley feels his anger surge. The orc lunges again but Hadley sidesteps and with one deadly thrust drives his sword between its ribs and into its heart. The brute collapses forward, dead weight landing hard at Hadley’s feet.</p><p>Elena slumps to the floor, the dagger clattering on the floorboards. Hadley steps into the room, one hand clamped over the slash on his forearm. Blood seeps between his fingers, dripping onto the floorboards. Both of them are breathing hard, the sounds sharp and raw in the sudden quiet.</p><blockquote class="alert alert-roll"><h4>Question</h4><div><p>Now the fight is over, I&rsquo;m wondering if Elena passes out again. Exertion and stress
might well have exhausted her but then again she&rsquo;s full of adrenaline. I&rsquo;ll check with
the oracle as an &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; question.</p><p>Oracle -12 / yes</p></div></blockquote><p>Hadley crouches beside her, voice steady. &ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; She nods, her face bleached of color. Then her eyes roll back and she slumps sideways, unconscious.</p></article></main></div><footer><p><a href=/licensing/>Licensing</a> - <a href=/posts/index.xml>RSS</a></p></footer></body></html>
