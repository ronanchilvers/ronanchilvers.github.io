I managed to keep the fire going but the wind from the bust roof was howling through the cabin all night and I just couldn&rsquo;t get warm. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m cold enough to get frostbite but I&rsquo;m glad I had my sleeping bag and some warm clothes. I&rsquo;m running quite low on water - think I&rsquo;ll have to try to find something to melt some snow in.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t believe the storm is still raging. Was feeling pretty bleak last night. I felt trapped by the storm, the snow&mldr; by life! Almost like this crazy situation is an expression of everything else that&rsquo;s been going on recently. I&rsquo;m starting to think that Matt and Ellie have set me up for some reason. Matt was always doing stupid stuff like this to people and Ellie would be swept up in the &ldquo;fun&rdquo;!</p><p>I shouldn&rsquo;t think like that. They&rsquo;re not here, I can&rsquo;t ask them about it. I should just think of other things like how to get the hell out of here. When it gets light I&rsquo;m going to try to get to the car. Even if the storm is <em>still</em> raging it&rsquo;ll be easier in daylight. If I take it slowly, I can get there.</p><h2 id=afternoon>Afternoon</h2><p>I&rsquo;m starting to think this place is haunted. Either that or I&rsquo;m imagining things. I made it a little way down the hike to the car - my ankle really hurts so I have to go slowly. The wind died down a little and I was feeling positive but then&mldr; something weird. I thought I heard laughing, coming from the forest. I shouted thinking it might be hikers, although what any hiker would be doing out in this weather is beyond me. There was no reply. I tried to follow the sound as best I could but didn&rsquo;t see anyone. Eventually I remembered that some animals make noises that sound a bit like laughter and thought it must have been that.</p><p>Then I heard it again. Definitely voices laughing, away in the trees. I think they might have been laughing at&mldr; me.</p></article></main><footer><p><a href=/about/>About</a> - <a href=/licensing/>Licensing</a> - <a href=/posts/index.xml>RSS</a></p></footer></body></html>
