<small>Thoughts on Playing TTRPGs</small></h3></div></div><div class="container content"><div class=post><h1 class=post-title>A Travel System</h1><span class=post-date>Friday, May 16, 2025</span><p>When a journey is undertaken the following steps are followed:</p><p><strong>Plan The Route</strong>
The party selects a route they want to take to their destination, determining how long it will take and what waypoints, if any, they will aim for. If they are at the Kaer, the Guild may be able to help them with maps and historical knowledge of the area.</p><p><strong>Prepare To Start</strong>
The party assigns the journey roles - Guide, Scout, Quartermaster, Wrangler - and gather equipment, rations, etc. They must decide if they are going to use horses or not - if so, the Guild can supply hardy ponies.</p><p><strong>Make The Journey</strong>
Each leg of the journey is handled by the various roles using ability checks to determine if anything untoward happens. Encounters are resolved as they happen.</p><h2 id=how-far-can-you-go>How far can you go?</h2><p>We assume that given favourable conditions, an average party can travel <em>10 miles per day on foot</em> and <em>15 miles per day on horseback</em>.</p><h2 id=plan-the-route>Plan the Route</h2><blockquote><p>[!note] GM Actons</p><ol><li>Describe the potential routes</li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>The party needs to choose their route as best they can, based on what they know of the area<ul><li>The Seers may be able to help with weather predictions</li><li>Adepts should consider the moon phases</li></ul></li><li>Determine waypoints on the journey<ul><li>A longer journey can be split up into waypoints if the party wishes</li><li>Each waypoint should be treated as a distinct journey or &ldquo;leg&rdquo; of the overall journey</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=prepare-to-set-out>Prepare to Set Out</h2><blockquote><p>[!note] GM Actions</p><ol><li>Create the <strong>travel clock</strong> with the <strong>Guide</strong></li><li>Create the <strong>rations clock</strong> with the <strong>Quartermaster</strong></li></ol></blockquote><ul><li>The Guild can supply the party with the basics for safe travel. Along with equipment (basic bedroll and travelling clothes) they can provide:<ul><li>A pony per party member. The ponies are a small, tough breed, well suited to hard journeys but not very fast.</li><li>Enough rations to keep the party going for 10 days (see the ration clock below).</li></ul></li><li>Choose roles<ul><li><strong>Guide</strong> - Intelligence - Characters taking on this role help ensure the group stays on track and heads in the right direction. They reference maps and physical distinguishing features to ensure the characters don&rsquo;t lose their way. The Guide is responsible for the <strong>travel clock</strong>.</li><li><strong>Scout</strong> - Wisdom - Characters taking on this role keep an eye out for nasty creatures and signs of recent activity (or activities yet to come). They&rsquo;re watching out for trouble.</li><li><strong>Quartermaster</strong> - Intelligence - The quartermaster ensures the health and well-being of the party. They make sure food stays unspoiled, enough water stays on hand, everyone&rsquo;s staying well-fed and well-hydrated, and everyone&rsquo;s socks are clean. The Quartermaster is responsible for the <strong>rations clock</strong>.</li><li><strong>Wrangler</strong> - Wisdom - (Optional) The stablehand is responsible for looking after the ponies, making sure they are fed, checking their hobbles and sorting out any issues like stones in their hooves, etc.</li></ul></li><li>Supporting a role<ul><li>A character can lend their support to one of the assigned roles if they wish to</li><li>The supporting character must make a travel check using the stat of the role they intend to support<ul><li>If the role succeeds the supported character may make their next travel check with <strong>Advantage</strong></li></ul></li><li>If the supporting character holds an assigned role, they must make their next travel check with <strong>Disadvantage</strong></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=make-the-journey>Make the Journey</h2><blockquote><p>[!note] GM Actions
