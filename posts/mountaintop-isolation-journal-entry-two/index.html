The fire&rsquo;s almost out and it looks like the snow really came down during the night as there are 6 foot drifts outside. It&rsquo;s around 6am I think - still dark. I&rsquo;m going to have to get some more wood in at some point - I put the last couple of logs on the fire a few minutes ago.</p><p>There&rsquo;s no one else here. I tried ringing Matt, and Ellie as well, but there&rsquo;s no signal. I&rsquo;m guessing that the snowfall has given them a load of hassle getting here. I might hike back to the car once it&rsquo;s light and see if there&rsquo;s any sign of them - they&rsquo;ll probably need help getting bags and stuff through the drifts - Ellie and Sam always bring too much stuff!!!</p><p>I&rsquo;m glad I won&rsquo;t be on my own up here. It&rsquo;s beautiful but it feels like I&rsquo;m on the edge of the wilds, kind of unwelcome. Strange feeling.</p><p>I read about some hikers a few years ago who got lost on the trails on these mountains during snow season. They were never seen again. I suppose there are still wild places where humans aren&rsquo;t welcome.</p></article><footer><p><a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/>CC-BY-NV 4.0</a> 2017 &ndash; 2025 | <a href=https://github.com/ronanchilvers>Github</a></p></footer></body></html>
