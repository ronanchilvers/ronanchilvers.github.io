Just been rooting about in the cupboards and found a few things. A packet of stale biscuits (ate them - they were ok, better than nothing) and a deck of cards. There was a note with the deck of cards that looks like it&rsquo;s the scores for a game - one player seems to have done really well. The creepy thing is that someone ( I suppose the loser) has written &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beat you next time&rdquo; on the paper - really scrawled and scratched it, even tore the paper a bit. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have found it creepy if I hadn&rsquo;t heard that weird laughing in the forest. I keep opening the door and listening but there&rsquo;s nothing out there. Nothing I can see anyway.</p><p>When I was searching the forest around the cabin for the laughing (slowly, as my ankle is really painful!) I think I saw what might be a trail down the mountain. It&rsquo;s filled with snow but it looks like a game trail or something. It seemed to go in the right direction at least. It&rsquo;s getting dark again now so I can&rsquo;t follow it but at first light I&rsquo;m going to see where it leads. It might be a way out. God, I really hope so!</p><h2 id=late-evening>Late evening</h2><p>Ok, something really strange just happened. I was by the fire. The wind has dropped a bit and I&rsquo;ve managed to block up the hole in the roof a bit more so I was actually feeling a little warmer. There was a lull in the wind and that&rsquo;s when I heard it - a soft tap tapping on the cabin door. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it - thought I was hearing things! I called out and tried to run to the door but forgot about my ankle. My foot just gave way and I went sprawling. Managed to get up and get to the door but when I opened it there was no one there. I know that sounds crazy but I&rsquo;m sure someone was knocking on the door. I&rsquo;m sure of it.</p><p>I&rsquo;m starting to feel really scared. All this creepy stuff is happening, I&rsquo;m can&rsquo;t call anyone, I can&rsquo;t get through the snow to the car (which is probably buried anyway), I have no food, the firewood is running low. This is a bad situation and every hour it seems to get worse.</p><p>I&rsquo;m starting to feel like I might not make it out of here.</p></article><footer><p><a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/>CC-BY-NV 4.0</a> 2017 &ndash; 2025 | <a href=https://github.com/ronanchilvers>Github</a></p></footer></body></html>
